# language-julia

Julia language support and snippets for Atom, forked from the (unmaintained)
[`atom-language-julia`](https://github.com/jonathanmarvens/atom-language-julia)
package.

## Highlighting

Includes multi-line comments, and most (if not all) types. And some exceptions.

## Greek letters

Typing the name of a greek letter will replace it by its unicode symbol. *E.g.*
`alpha` will become `α`. Includes upper and lowercase letters. *Note that*,
unlike in the `julia` REPL, you need not preface the letter name with `\`.
